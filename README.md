# 📌 CRYPTO CAROUSEL

## 📝 Description

This is a carousel that contains the details, tokenomics, and tags of my favorite cryptocurrencies (safe to say: any coin on this carousel is on my watchlist 😂). It is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python technologies. This component also uses the Swiper JS framework for the pagination effect.

## 🚀 Features

- Easy to use
- Displays live market tokenomics
- Only used on bigger screens (i.e., laptops and computers)
- **NOT RESPONSIVE**

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS (for styling)
- Swiper JS framework (for pagination effect)
- JavaScript (ES15)
- Hosted Python server for fetching live market data
- Python file (app.py) to fetch each cryptocurrency profile pic

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Click on the website link
2. Refresh the browser if the live market data is still not displayed (not my fault... it's all on render)
3. Scroll endlessly to view the top cryptocurrencies on my watchlist... maybe add them to your portfolio 🤑🤝 (THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)

## ⚙️ Python Backend Server

The live market tokenomic data of each cryptocurrency on this carousel is fetched through a simple Python server, which I have used in some of my other projects (feel free to check them out).

- The server pulls the data from the CoinGecko API and makes it available to the frontend through JavaScript.
- For privacy reasons, the Python server isn't open-sourced.
- It is hosted on **Render**.
- To view the Python code, please open an issue, and the code will be sent to you privately.

## 🖥️ Desktop View

- This site is fully optimized for desktop view.
- Smaller screen sizes haven't been optimized yet, but I plan on doing that in the next upgrade (please bear with me 🙏).

## 🛑 Important Notes

If for any reason you choose to invest in any of the currencies displayed on this site... Please DYOR before investing. **THE FINANCIAL MARKET IS A VOLATILE ONE... "BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS"**
