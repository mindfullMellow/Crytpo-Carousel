# 📌 CRYPTO CAROSEUL

## 📝 Description

This is a carousel that contains the details, tokenomics and tags of my favourite cryptocurrencies (safe to say: any coin on this carousel is on my watchlist😂).It is built with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and PYTHON technologies.This component also uses the swiper js framework for the pagination effect.

## 🚀 Features

- Easy to use
- Displays live market tokenomics
- Only used on bigger screens (i.e laptops and computers)
- NOT RESPONSIVE

## 📦 Tech Stacks

- HTML
- CSS(for styling)
- SWIPER js framework (for pagination effect)
- JAVASCRIPT (ES15)
- Hosted PYTHON server for fetching live market data
- PYTHON file (app.py) to fetch each cryptocurrency profile pic

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Click on the website link
2. Refresh the browser if the live market data are still not displayed (not my fault.. its all on render)
3. Scroll endlessly to view the top Cryptocurrency on my watchlist..maybe add them to your portfoilo 🤑🤝 (THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE )

## ⚙️ Python Backend Server

The live market tokenomic data of each cryptocurrency on this carousel is fecth through a simple python server which i have use on some of my other projects(feel free.. to check them out )

- The server pulls the data from coingecko API and make them available to the frontend through Javascript
- For privacy reasons the Python server isn't open-sourced
- It is hosted on render
- To view the python code, please open an issue and the code will be sent to you privately

## 🖥️ Desktop View

- This site is fully optimized for Desktop view
- Smaller screen haven't been optimized but i plan on doing that by the next upgrade (pls..bear with me 🙏)
