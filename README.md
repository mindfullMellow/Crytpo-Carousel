# 📌 CRYPTO CAROSEUL

## 📝 Description

This is a carousel that contains the details, tokenomics and tags of my favourite cryptocurrencies (safe to say: any coin on this carousel is on my watchlist😂).It is built with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and PYTHON technologies.This component also uses the swiper js framework for the pagination effect.

## 🚀 Features

- Easy to use
- Displays live market tokenomics
- Only used on bigger screens (i.e laptops and computers)
- NOT RESPONSIVE

## 📦 Tech Stacks

- HTML
- CSS(for styling)
- SWIPER js framework (for pagination effect)
- JAVASCRIPT (ES15)
- Hosted PYTHON server for fetching live market data
- PYTHON file (app.py) to fetch each cryptocurrency profile pic

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Click on the website link
2. Refresh the browser if the live market data are still not displayed (not my fault.. its all on render)
3. Scroll endlessly to view the top Cryptocurrency on my watchlist..maybe add them to your portfoilo (THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE )
